#### Edmonds Karp Algorithm

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It improves upon the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm by using a specific choice of augmenting paths known as the shortest augmenting path.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm:

Start with an initial flow of zero on all edges of the network.

While there exists a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph (a graph that represents the remaining capacity on each edge), do the following steps:

a. Find the shortest path from the source to the sink using breadth-first search (BFS) in the residual graph. The shortest path is determined by considering the minimum capacity edge along the path.

b. Calculate the maximum possible flow that can be pushed through the found path. This value is the minimum capacity of the edges along the path.

c. Update the flow and residual capacities of the edges along the path based on the maximum flow calculated in the previous step.

When there are no more paths from the source to the sink in the residual graph, the algorithm terminates, and the maximum flow is computed.

Advantages of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm:

Guaranteed termination: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm terminates after a finite number of iterations, even if the capacities are real numbers.

Efficient runtime: The use of breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path ensures that the algorithm runs in O(V * E^2) time complexity, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This makes it more efficient than the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which can have worst-case exponential runtime.

Disadvantages of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm:

Memory requirements: The algorithm needs to store the residual graph, which can have O(V^2) space complexity, where V is the number of vertices. In graphs with a large number of vertices, this can consume significant memory.

Performance with large capacities: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm might not perform well when the capacity of edges is large. This is because it favors augmenting paths with fewer edges, potentially leading to a large number of iterations to find the maximum flow.

Overall, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is a widely used and efficient method for solving the maximum flow problem in flow networks, offering guaranteed termination and improved runtime compared to the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. However, it might face memory limitations and could be less efficient when dealing with large edge capacities.
