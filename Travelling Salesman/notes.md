#### Travelling Salesman Problem with Dynamic Programming

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. It is named after the analogy of a salesperson who wants to visit a set of cities and find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Formally, the TSP can be defined as follows: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The distances between cities are typically represented by a distance matrix or an adjacency matrix.

We will use Dynamic Programming

**Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It is applicable to problems that exhibit the optimal substructure property, which means that an optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

The key idea behind dynamic programming is to store the solutions to subproblems in a table or memoization array, allowing efficient reuse of these solutions when needed. By avoiding redundant calculations and reusing previously computed results, dynamic programming can greatly improve the efficiency of solving complex problems.
