#### Capacity Scaling

The capacity scaling heuristic is a technique used in certain algorithms for solving the maximum flow problem, including the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. It improves the efficiency of these algorithms by exploiting the properties of the flow network.

The capacity scaling heuristic works by iteratively increasing a scaling parameter and adjusting the capacities of the edges in the network accordingly. The idea is to focus on the edges with high capacities while ignoring or reducing the impact of edges with low capacities.

Here's how the capacity scaling heuristic is typically implemented:

Initialize the scaling parameter to a high value (e.g., the largest capacity in the network).

While the scaling parameter is greater than zero, perform the following steps:

    a. Run the maximum flow algorithm on the network, considering only the edges with capacities greater than or equal to the current 
        scaling parameter. This step effectively ignores or reduces the impact of low-capacity edges.

    b. If there is a positive flow from the source to the sink in the resulting flow network, update the maximum flow.

    c. Reduce the scaling parameter. This can be done by dividing it by a fixed factor (e.g., 2).

Return the maximum flow obtained after all iterations.

The capacity scaling heuristic works well when there is a significant difference in capacities between edges in the flow network. By gradually reducing the scaling parameter, the algorithm progressively focuses on lower-capacity edges, effectively converging to the optimal maximum flow.

This heuristic helps avoid unnecessary computations on edges with negligible capacities, improving the runtime of the maximum flow algorithm. However, it may not be as effective in networks with uniformly distributed capacities or when the difference between capacities is relatively small.

The capacity scaling heuristic is a useful optimization technique, particularly in scenarios where the flow network exhibits large disparities in edge capacities.
