#### Depth First Search

DFS plunges depth first into a graph without regard of what node it traverses next, until it can’t go any further. It then backtracks and continues. DFS has a time complexity of O(V+E). Augmented versions of DFS algorithm are often used to solve problems related to Connect Components, Compute MST, Find Cycles, Check if graph is bipartite, Find Strongly Connected Components, Topological Sort the Nodes of graph, Find Bridges and Articulation Points, Generate Mazes

#### Breadth First Search

BFS starts by exploring a node’s neighbors. Having done that, it moves onto the next level of neighbors. BFS has a time complexity of  O(V+E).
